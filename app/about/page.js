        <p>
          I'm Elvis Kiprono, an aspiring full stack web developer based in Kenya. I'm passionate about building modern,
          responsive, and interactive web applications. My journey in software development started with a love for
          solving real-world problems using code.
        </p>

        <p>
          I specialize in both front-end and back-end technologies such as React, Tailwind CSS, Flask, and Python.
          I enjoy bringing ideas to life through elegant user interfaces and well-structured APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technologies, improving my skills on GitHub, or collaborating
          on exciting projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm currently open to internship and junior developer opportunities, and always eager to learn and grow.
